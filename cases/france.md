# 1 Centralized Identity Files
Administrative procedures, identity documents, biometric registries, and databases of foreign nationals are increasingly interconnected and retained for long periods. Centralization raises the risk of massive data leaks, automated cross-matching, and lasting privacy breaches if these datasets are compromised or misused.

# 2 Metadata Retention and Exploitation
Telecom operators and online services retain vast amounts of metadata (who calls whom, when, and where), accessible to authorities through legal requests or cooperation. Even without content, metadata allows the reconstruction of social networks, movements, and habits, enabling powerful profiling capabilities.

# 3 Video Surveillance and Facial Recognition
The dense network of urban cameras, combined with facial recognition and tracking tools, enables continuous monitoring of individuals in public spaces. Experimental uses in certain regions and biometric matching tests pose clear risks of social surveillance and wrongful targeting of vulnerable groups.
