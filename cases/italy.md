# 1. Political signalling    
Polarizing cultural wars have disincentivized social and political expression, as individuals fear being "cancelled" by their personal and professional circles. While voting is anonymous, we need a daily, anonymous, but verifiable system for expressing political views without risking personal identity.

# 2. Freedom of Speech
Government suppression of journalists who uphold integrity creates a disincentive to speak the truth, undermining open communication and press freedom.

# 3. Fake News to Fake History
Historical revisionism surrounding events like the Treno Italicus, Piazza della Loggia, and Piazza Fontana massacres threatens to distort the truth, perpetuated by government forces and ideological heirs of the perpetrators.
