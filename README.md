## Local Cases

#### Political Signalling

Polarizing cultural wars have disincentivized social and political expression, as individuals fear being "cancelled" by their personal and professional circles. While voting is anonymous, we need a daily, anonymous, but verifiable system for expressing political views without risking personal identity.

#### Freedom of Speech

Government suppression of journalists who uphold integrity creates a disincentive to speak the truth, undermining open communication and press freedom.
