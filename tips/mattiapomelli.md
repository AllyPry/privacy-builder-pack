1. **Build the right team.** I recommend teaming up with people you’ve already worked with before and to keep the team small (2-3 people).

2. **Keep your scope small.** It’s better to build something small but do it well than having a big vision but not delivering on it.

3. **Talk with the sponsors.** Learn what the sponsors want and need. Often they're looking to see new use cases built with their tech, a new integration, etc.

4. **Have a great demo.** You should clearly show how your project works and allow people to test it themselves with low friction.

5. **Build something new.** Hackathons are the place to get creative. Use new trending tech, combine different sponsor tools, and find a unique use cases.
