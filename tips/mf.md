1. **DonÂ´t give up!** Take a short break, figure out the bottleneck, and solve that issue. Allowing yourself to stay optimistic is a key element to win.

2. **Avoid feature creep!** The priority should be defined as the "Need" for your function to work. Find your "core" items and obsess about making them.

3. **Time management is key.** Don't waste time on irrelevant tasks, make quick decisions teamwise, and once your team made an agreement, don't argue anymore but focus on the next step.

4. **Delegate and Conquer.** Find each teammates best skill and let them focus on this. The responsible person gets to make the mandatory decisions for that part.

5. **Diverge and Converge.** Once you all have an agreed clear idea, diverge and work independently on your part. Come up with a few options if a team discussion is required, and then converge together to make a joint decision.

6. **Democracy works.** Make sure everyone is onboard before you finalise  what idea you'll work on. Everyone deserves to be heard, which will push your team to work even harder together being onboard together. Bring up disagreements, and make an anonymous final vote to decide how to go forward.

7. **Live, laugh, build.** Make fun of the code, talk shit about the protocol you're trying to implement, joke on the provided coffee quality. Moral is important, not only for yourself, but also for your team. There will be plenty of tiresome moments, it's up to you to make those a good memory.
