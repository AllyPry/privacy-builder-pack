1. **Pick 1 goal** and put others as secondary priorities:
  - Build a finalist project.
  - Hunt for bounties.
  - Work on a long-term project.
  - Hiring.

2. Stop adding more features! **Focus on MVP** and create a list of priorities.

3. **Focus on most basic features**, understand the potential flaws and explore them only if you have time at the end (be transparent about them in your presentation).

4. **Understand the roles** of each member of the team, and make sure everyone manages expectations.

5. Don't be afraid to **ask questions early on**. Some things will save you hours of work by simply asking a partner or a mentor to point you in the right direction.

6. Sometimes you simply need to g**o talk to someone, take a walk, a nap or even shift focus for a bit** and the problems will be "magically" solved.

7. **Don't overcomplicate the narrative**. Even if the tech is super complex and cool try to find a way to tell it with an example and in a way that can be grasped in the first sentences.

8. **Simple pitch** outline:
   - Team
   - Problem
   - Solution
   - Example use-case
   - Tech
   - Demo
   - Future/Vision
